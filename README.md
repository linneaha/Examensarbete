## Abstract

People with ADHD have difficulty managing their time and may struggle with organizing their daily activities. 
This thesis describes the development of a prototype for a web application designed to help people with ADHD 
organize their time by functioning as a timer for activities and breaks, and providing the user with an overview of the time spent. 

The project is based on a mockup developed from a previous assignment in UX technology and the theoretical framework of ADHD and its symptoms 
affecting time organization. Various techniques were investigated, and discussions about the database structure were conducted to identify the 
most appropriate solution for the project. The development process of the prototype, including user interface and features, is then described. 
The prototype includes features that allow the user to set different timers for different modes and the ability to add activities, as well as a 
statistics function that shows the average time spent. Finally, the work summarizes the development of the prototype and its potential to improve 
the quality of life for individuals with ADHD by helping them organize their time. It is also highlighted that not all planned features could be 
implemented, and suggestions for further development are provided.

The prototype is built using React.js, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB Atlas.

Keywords: ADHD, app development, timer, time organization.
